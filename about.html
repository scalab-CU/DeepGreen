          </label>
          <div class="collapsibleContent">
            This project aims to comprehensively understand the opportunities enabled by liquid immersion cooling, and explore its full potential to boost energy efficiency for high performance computing (HPC) under various thermal and power constraints. Improving energy efficiency, i.e., the ratio of performance to total power consumption, is crucial to sustain performance growth and realize exascale computing within 20 MW of power. HPC systems consume tremendous amounts of power for not only computing but also cooling to keep compute components within their thermal limits. In this project, we investigate liquid immersion HPC systems to optimize overall energy efficiency. we propose to develop machine learning models and system software to understand and optimize energy efficiency and reliability for workloads running on liquid immersion HPC systems. Our experimental platform is a Submer SmartPodX immersion cooling system.

          </label>
          <div class="collapsibleContent">
            The Capstone course is a class available to Clemson University juniors and seniors in the School of Computing. In this course students work in small teams (4-5 students) with industry clients on a real-world computer science project by playing the part of an independent consulting firm. Teams are expected to communicate with their client and plan out what they are responsible for throughout the semester they are working. The capstone aspect of this project works with Dr. Rong Ge and Submer as clients to contribute meaningful insights to the overall research topic of the effectiveness fully immersive cooling has over traditional cooling approaches.
